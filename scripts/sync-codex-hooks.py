"""Regenerate .codex/hooks.json from .claude/settings.json's `hooks` block.

.claude/settings.json is the single source of truth for hook wiring. Codex reads
its hooks from .codex/hooks.json, so this generator keeps that file in lock-step
with Claude instead of hand-editing.

Codex's own configuration lives in .codex/config.toml (approval policy, sandbox
mode, shell env) and ~/.codex/config.toml (model, reasoning effort). Claude keys
like `model: opus` or `permissions.allow` are not copied there.

Codex supports most, but not all, Claude hook events and uses structured JSON
instead of non-zero exit codes for blocking. This generator therefore:

- drops explicitly classified unsupported events, matchers, and redundant handlers,
- resolves shared scripts from the git root so subdirectory sessions work, and
- wraps command hooks with the Codex compatibility adapter, and
- adds Windows handler forms and adjusts known compatibility limits.

Invoked by scripts/sync-codex-context.py after the repository skill mirror.

`to_codex_hooks` is pure and unit-tested
(scripts/hooks/tests/test_sync_codex_hooks.py).
